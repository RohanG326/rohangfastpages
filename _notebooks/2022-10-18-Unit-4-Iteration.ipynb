    "Iteration may be one of the most crucial features for any programming language, since they allow computers to do what they do best: do copious amounts of menial tasks quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, Java can also perform iteration using numerous different structures. Today we'll be going over some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the exam weights Iteration as 17.5-22.5% of the test, with 7-9 MC and part of FRQ 1. This is one of the largest if not the largest unit, so understanding how iteration works is critical to performance on the test as well as in basically all aspects of coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall purpose of iteration is to simplify code by allowing it to repeat. Loops will usually include some sort of conditional to check against, and while that conditional is true, the code within the loop will repeat. "
