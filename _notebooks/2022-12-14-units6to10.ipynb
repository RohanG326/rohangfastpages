    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "- Polymorphism can be used when we have multiple classes that are related by inheritance. It is utilized when a method is implemented to perform different tasks in different classes. It essentially allows a method to take on multiple “forms” or implementations based on the specific object it is acting upon.\n",
    "- Polymorphism is useful for code reusability, as it re-implements an existing class’s attributes and methods for new classes. A real life example of polymorphism could be a sport. A sport can take on different forms, as it can be soccer, basketball, baseball, etc.\n"
