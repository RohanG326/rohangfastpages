# Week 3
## If Statements
- an if statement is a conditional piece of code that executes a certain procedure once a condition is met
- an if else statement is a conditional piece of code as well but if the condition is not met, then it executes a different procedure
- an if else-if else is a conditional piece of code that executes a certain procedure but if the condition is not met, it executes a different conditional, but if that is not met either, then it executes the last else
- De Morgan's law is an action you can do to a conditional that if you take the not(!) of a condition, it flips all the trues to false and the and(&&) operators to or(||) or vice versa

# Week 2
## Code.org
- learned about the basics of object oriented programming using the Painter
- used a lot of logic operators and iteration in the lessons to get the Painter to move and perform actions such as taking paint and painting after moving in certain directions
- used a lot of conditionals and classes to perform tasks as a software engineer
- learned about methods and inheritance that allows for the extension of classes in a subclass
- inheritance by using extends allows for the subclass to inherit the attributes of a parent class as a means of abstraction

## Menu Planning
- As nicm2 is not here this week, I gotta do it solo
- I'm just going to implement basic math functions such as gcd, lcm, and fibonacci as well as a slightly more complex compound interest calculator within the menu
- idea for the future is a jeopardy trivia class
- in progress currently, but only barebones key value pairs for now
- Need to implement a constructor and a method to check answers, then build
- Looking to fix GUI issues with xlaunch and do more for the menu
- It was difficult without a partner this week although


# Week 1  
## Primitives
- Primitives are basic data values such as integers, doubles, and booleans
- building block of primitives are characters
- primitives in java need to be defined to be used
- can do mathematical operations on doubles and ints
- Strings are not primitives and use capital S when instantiated

## CMD Learning
- "explorer.exe ." to open bashrc and hidden folders
- make alias in bashrc to run shortcut commands in terminal
- gitfast to pull from github
- openfast to open rohangfastpages in vscode
