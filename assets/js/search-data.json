            "content": "Takeaway Paragraph from the Presentation . Computer Science is the future. No matter what field you in, especially in engineering, there is a necessity for programming. Object Oriented Programming that you learn in Java is a fundamental part of all programming, and by learning the interactions of different objects and classes, then you can code anything you want. In the programming/Computer Science space, especially in college, something to worry about is the clash of Egos. A lot of Computer Science majors have done a lot outside of school and have a lot of programming experience, but it‚Äôs important to focus on the personal struggle that can drive you to achieve new heights. Another issue that one can come across is motivation. Sometimes when you start a new project, you will have a lot of errors and nothing will go right at first, but it is important to persevere through the initial discomfort of starting and keep trying. All issues can be solved through Google, so don‚Äôt be afraid to keep searching. Projects are dynamic, and have a lot of moving factors that change all the time, so its important to keep track of the different variables in your life and manage them well to achieve success. You are not expected to know everything, so don‚Äôt be afraid if you feel lost or confused on a topic. As long as you keep trying and work hard to understand the material, you will be successful. No matter what field you go into, CS will be applicable. Even if you are not doing a lot of specific coding, you are still learning a lot of problem solving skills for your field. Pathfinding algorithms as personal projects for work experience. Anything really in Data Visualization. For getting a job in the CS field, make a resume, make a LinkedIn, and start reaching out and adding people on LinkedIn. Eventually you‚Äôll get a hit. Overall, to be successful in CS, just be unrelenting and persevere through struggles! .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .
